Romman Nurik for the initial contribution with [swipe to dismiss](https://github.com/romannurik/Android-SwipeToDismiss) for `ListView`

See the original [Google+ post](https://plus.google.com/+RomanNurik/posts/Fgo1p5uWZLu) for discussion.

See also [Jake Wharton's port](https://github.com/JakeWharton/SwipeToDismissNOA) of this sample code to old versions of Android using the [NineOldAndroids](http://nineoldandroids.com/) compatibility library.
